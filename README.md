<h1>Electricity Load Diagrams Processing</h1>

<div>
This project is based on the undergraduate class of Data Science in the University Of Pireaus.<br>
It consists of multiple steps of processing of the dataset described bellow.<br>
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014">Electricity Load Diagrams</a>,that consists of measurments spanning 4 years from an energy provider in Portugal.You can download the dataset from the link.The name of the dataset is <b>LD2011_2014.txt</b> and imported in the example.</div>

<br><div><h2>Part 1:Preprocessing</h2>
In the first section we preprocess the dataset and plot the minimum,maximum and mean consumption for each client.<br>
We also draw conclusions for seasonality and trend characteristics of each Timeseries.
</div>

<br><div><h2>Clustering</h2>
This section shows an example of clustering using K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms,using the sci-kit learn(sklearn) implementations of each algorithm.
</div>

<br><div><h2>Prediction/Machine Learning</h2></div>
In the last part we split the dataset into train and test subsets with sklearn functions.
Afterward we create a model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with tensorflow/keras and a Regression styled model<br>
using the Random Forests model of tensorflow.
